Short term:
-----------
* Merge with Node Efficiency Tools (NET) - thanks Bartek!
* Improve NET texture setup (Ctrl+T on texture nodes to add setup; fix mapping node size; add mapping between coord and texture)
* Improve NET Merge nodes (preference not to Hide node; place in center with dimensions)
* Add driver for mapping node (option for offset) - drive the position, rotation and scale with an Empty
* Link Sky Texture vector with a Sun Lamp's rotation
* Color ramp element positions (node.color_ramp.elements[0])
* WHen viewing the image/mask/clip of a node, add button to header to jump back to node editor
* Add Vertex colors menu (same as UV Layers)
* Check for existance of UV layers or vert cols before appending to the menu
* Show a list of hotkeys in user prefs (in expandable box)

Long Term:
----------
* Tools for object/material index (both shading and compositing noodles, and for assigning)
* Node templates (store selection, new menu in Shift+A menu, new panel in toolbar) [something like this exists already? where?]
* Better auto-arrange that uses the starting position of nodes and centers them nicely rather than a long row at the top and ugly vertical 'columns'
