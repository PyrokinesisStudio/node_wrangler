Ideas for "Swap Node Type":

Long term
1.
Main idea is to be able to change any node type to any other available node type.

2.
"History" of the node should be stored. When "swapping back" (different than "undo" - previous data could get restored.
This is possible, because temporary list could be created where several parameters could be stored.
the node has its "history". It once was "Mix" and gad some paramsters, then we "swapped" it to "Blur", then to "Math" and so on.
All parameters that this node had can be stored.
It can be done by giving the class some property, called "history" or whatever.
When we execute the operator - data get added or removed from this property.
It works such that those data are stored in clipboard, so they disappear only after quitting blender.
I used this functionality in "Copy Render Layer" Add On.

3.
Some hierarchy need to be created, such that we know when take settings from current "state" of the node and when take them from "history".

4.
Warnings: We should be able to warn the user that for example: "Some links may be lost".
History should as well store info about "lost links" such that when we "swap" to type that can use those lost links - it can.

5.
Interface: I think we could make a menu to look exactly the same as "Add Node" menu. Users know where to look for nodes in this manu because they keep adding nodes all the time.
When we execute the operator we are presented with all the nodes. The header would only be different: Instead of saying: "Add", it could say "Swap to".
